# shiphydrostatics
This project is a ship hydrostatics and structural analysis toolbox. It demonstrates how to determine equilibrium conditions (draft, trim, buoyancy balance) and evaluate structural responses under distributed loads. Useful for naval architecture coursework, hydrostatics studies, and ship design projects.
